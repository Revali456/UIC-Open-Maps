# Shortest Distance Finder Application

**Author:** Ahmik Ruben Nallamala

## Description
`application.cpp` controls the main application that finds the shortest distance between two points on a map and displays the exact distance between them along with the meeting point.

This application was developed as part of the CS 251 course, Fall 2023, at the University of Illinois Chicago. The original variation of the project was conceived by Dr. Joe Hummel.

## Usage
To use this application, compile and run the `application.cpp` file. Follow the prompts to input the starting and ending points on the map, and the application will calculate and display the shortest distance between them.
